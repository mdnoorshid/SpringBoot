#If none of the other providers can be found, a simple implementation using a ConcurrentHashMap as the cache 
#store is configured. This is the default if no caching library is present in your application. By default, 
#caches are created as needed, but you can restrict the list of available caches by setting the cache-names 
#property. For instance, if you want only cache1 and cache2 caches, set the cache-names property.

#By defualt in auto-configuration for cache it gonna use ConcurrentMapCacheManager class

spring.cache.cache-names=employeeCache
#If type is none then cache will be disable for the entire application
